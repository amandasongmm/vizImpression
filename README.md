Tensorflow implementation of "Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization"

## VGG Pretrained Weight

The file is beyond 100M limitation so I store it into my Google Drive. Download [VGG Pretrained](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12lGgU9XjM4qIYzDJ7GtbjfEmcYir0E15) from here. Then put it into directory "trained_models/VGG".
